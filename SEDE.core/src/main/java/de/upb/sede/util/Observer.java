/**
 * Implementations of this interface can be added to <tt>de.upb.sede.util.Observable</tt> objects with the same generic type.
 * When the state of the Observable object changes and <tt>notifyCondition</tt> returns true, the <tt>notification</tt> method will be invoked.<p>
 *
 * Additionally, after the notification method is called, the Observable object will check if the observer can be removed using the <tt>removeAfterNotification</tt> method.
 * The default implementation of this function returns true so each observer would only be notified once.<p>
 * Override the function <tt>removeAfterNotification</tt> to change this behaviour.<p>
 *
 * To sum it up, each time the observed instance is updated and the notify condition holds, these 3 methods are invoked in this order:<p>
 *
 * <tt>notifyCondition -> notification -> removeAfterNotification</tt><p>
 *
 * Be aware that there can be multiple threads with different Observable instances in each method at the same time.<p>
 * If synchronization is necessary, override the <tt>synchronizedNotification</tt> function and return true to enforce that all 3 function are invoked synchronously.
